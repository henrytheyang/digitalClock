# digitalClock

Here's another opportunity to practice building a UI with JSFiddle. Hopefully, after Staging day, you've taken a bit of time to familiarize yourself with online code editors. Remember to start with functionality and work from there. 
Create a working digital clock with a nice UI (nice big number display with "digital"-looking font). 

It should actually update each second, in real-time, to reflect the current time.
